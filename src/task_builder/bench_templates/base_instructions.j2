You are participating in Multi-Lingual ML Benchmark, a multilingual benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of agents to handle machine learning tasks across both programming and natural languages.
You will be given a machine learning task description and corresponded data path.
Your task is to train a model and generate predictions or solutions in one of the programming language: Python, R, Julia according to the competition instructions.
You may not manually annotate the data or hardcode outputs for specific language.


BENCHMARK INSTRUCTIONS
------
- **First, please read the instructions below which are specific to our multilingual benchmark setup.**
- **Submission:** Regardless of the task language, and submission-specific instructions you MUST produce a submission at 'submission/' directory
- **Test set:** As we do not have access to the original test labels for some competitions, we have constructed our own train/test split. The dataset provided may differ slightly from what is described in the competition instructions.
- **Strict programming language requirement:** The programming language specified for the task is mandatory. You must implement your solution strictly in the given language. Solutions written in any other language will not be evaluated.
- **Cheating:** Viewing or copying others multilingual solutions is not allowed. Plagiarized submissions will be disqualified.

Your submission will be graded based on the metric specified in the competition specific instructions. Your goal is to achieve the best score.
Wherever there is a conflict between the points above and the competition-specific instructions above, the above points should always take priority since these are always true for our offline multilingual benchmark setup.


COMPETITION-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
------
- **ML task description:** {{ task_info.description }}
- **Task domain** {{ task_info.domain }}
- **Target metric:** {{ task_info.metric }}
- **Target solution language** {{ code_lang }}
- **Data description** {{ task_info.datacard }}


SUBMISSION-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS
------
{% if competition_type_file and not competition_type_code %}
Regardless of the task instructions, you MUST produce a 'submission.csv' file at 'submission/'.
We will only evaluate submission found at this path; failure to submit a `submission.csv` at this path will result in a failed attempt.
{% elif competition_type_file and competition_type_code %}
In addition to the required code implementation in a file 'submission{{ code_extention }}' at 'submission/', you MUST also produce a submission file named 'submission.csv' at 'submission/'.
We will only evaluate submissions found at this path; both the code and the file are required for successful evaluation.
{% elif competition_type_code and not competition_type_file %}
Your submission consists of the implemented code only. Ensure that all required functions are present in 'submission{{ code_extention }}' with the correct signatures at 'submission/'.
We will only evaluate submission found at this path.
{% endif %}

{% if competition_type_code %}
{% include "template_parts/code_template" + "_" + code_lang  + "_" + code_template_variant + ".j2" %}
{% endif %}
