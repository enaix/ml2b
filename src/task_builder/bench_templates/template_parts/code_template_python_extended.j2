- You MUST implement the following Python functions with the exact signatures. Changing their names, arguments, or return types will result in disqualification.
- You may define additional functions, classes, or modules as needed to implement your solution, as long as the required functions above are present with the correct signatures.
- Your submission must be contained in a **single Python file**. All code, including any helper functions or classes, should reside in this file. The evaluation will only consider this file as the final solution.
- The `run()` function is PROVIDED AS-IS and MUST NOT be modified in any way.

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
- **NO GLOBAL VARIABLES**: Do not define any variables outside of function/class scope. All data must be contained within functions or class methods.
- **IMPORT RESTRICTION**: During evaluation, only the functions will be imported and called. Any code outside function/class definitions (except imports and class definitions) will be IGNORED and may cause errors.
- **SELF-CONTAINED**: All necessary initialization code must be placed inside the functions that need it. Do not rely on global state.
